XUL i.e., XML User Interface Language, is basically DHTML for web applications. DHTML(Dynamic HTML) is now outdated but it was designed to build webpage interface using direct control with js but now there are better alternatives. XUL was designed to build interface for web application like Mozilla firefox browser etc.
